# Kitabu

Kitabu (Swahili for book) parses through `.txt` book files to gather pertinent data for the book.

_This is a code challenge for **The League**._

## Getting started

1.  Install dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2.  Run the server, should start on port 3000.

    Production:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    Development:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  Make a `GET` request to the server with the name of the file as the url parameter. For example:

    ```
    http://localhost:3000/adventures-of-sherlock-holmes
    ```

**Useful Routes:**

1.  Testing

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
